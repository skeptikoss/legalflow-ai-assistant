# PLANNING.md - LegalFlow AI Assistant Strategic Planning

## The Vision: 90-Second Legal Transformation

### What We're Really Building
Not a document generator. We're building **a glimpse into the future of legal practice**.

**The Story We're Telling:**
"While you were reading this sentence, our AI just drafted an engagement letter that would have taken you 45 minutes."

### The Wow We're Engineering
```

## Strategic Approach: Depth Over Breadth

### Why One Document Type Will Win
**Choice: M&A Engagement Letter**
- Highest complexity = Most impressive AI demonstration
- Highest value = Best ROI story (S$500/hour lawyers)
- Most variation = Shows AI intelligence best
- Singapore focus = Leverages IMDA backing story

### The Technical Stack (Radically Simplified)

```javascript
// The entire backend in 3 files
server.js         // 100 lines - Just 3 endpoints
generator.js      // 200 lines - Claude integration + templates  
demo.js          // 50 lines - Demo scenarios and shortcuts

// The entire frontend in 1 file
index.html       // Single page with inline CSS/JS using Alpine.js
```

**Why This Stack:**
- **No build process** = More time for polish
- **No database** = No complexity
- **No authentication** = Straight to wow
- **CDN everything** = No package management

## Day-by-Day Execution Plan

### Day 1 (18 Aug): First Impressions
**Morning Sprint (4 hours): The UI That Sells**
```html
<!-- This is what they see first - it must be stunning -->
<div class="gradient-animated-background">
  <h1 class="typewriter-effect">
    Your Next Engagement Letter: 90 Seconds Away
  </h1>
  <!-- Beautiful form that feels like magic -->
</div>
```

**Key Deliverables:**
- [ ] Stunning single-page UI that looks S$50K not bootstrap
- [ ] Smooth animations (Tailwind + Alpine.js transitions)
- [ ] Smart form that adapts as you type
- [ ] Claude API streaming working with typewriter effect

**Afternoon Sprint (3 hours): The Intelligence**
```javascript
// The prompt that makes magic happen
const MASTER_PROMPT = `
You are Singapore's most experienced M&A lawyer.
Create an engagement letter that:
1. Addresses specific risks for ${transactionType}
2. Uses sophisticated legal language
3. Includes Singapore-specific requirements
4. Adapts tone for ${clientProfile}

Show your reasoning for each customisation.
`;
```

**Success Metric:** By end of day, can generate real content with visible AI reasoning

### Day 2 (19 Aug): The Magic Layer
**Morning Sprint (4 hours): Visible Intelligence**
```javascript
// Make the AI's thinking visible
const streamReasoning = async (stage, detail) => {
  await updateUI({
    stage,
    detail,
    icon: getAnimatedIcon(stage),
    progress: calculateProgress(stage)
  });
  // This creates the "wow, it's actually thinking" moment
};
```

**Key Features:**
- [ ] Real-time reasoning display with stages

  const savedPerLetter = 43.5 * 60 * (hourlyRate / 60);
  const annualSaving = savedPerLetter * letterCount * 50; // 50 weeks
  return {
    timeBack: `${letterCount * 43.5} minutes per week`,
    moneyBack: `S$${annualSaving.toLocaleString()}`,
    lifeBack: "Dinner with family instead of drafting"
  };
};
```

## The Demo Flow (Minute by Minute)

### 0:00-0:30 - The Hook
**You:** "How long did your last engagement letter take?"  
**Them:** "About 30-45 minutes"  
**You:** "Let me show you 90 seconds that will change your practice"

### 0:30-1:30 - The Problem
Show the traditional process timeline (visual pain)
- Open precedent â†’ Copy â†’ Paste â†’ Edit â†’ Review â†’ Format
- "This is your current reality, 10 times a day"

### 1:30-3:30 - The Magic
**Live Demonstration**
- Type: "TechVentures acquiring DataCo for $50M"
- **First Wow:** Form auto-fills intelligently
- **Second Wow:** AI reasoning appears live
- **Third Wow:** Progress bar: "Saving you 43.5 minutes..."
- **Fourth Wow:** Perfect PDF appears

### 3:30-4:30 - The Impact
**ROI Display** (numbers animate up)
- Time saved: 36.5 hours/month
- Cost saved: S$219,000/year
- Compliance: 100% Singapore requirements met

## Technical Implementation Details

### The Three Files That Matter

#### 1. `index.html` - The Experience
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/alpinejs" defer></script>
  <style>
    /* Custom animations that create wow */
    @keyframes gradient { /* Animated background */ }
    @keyframes typewriter { /* Text appears like typing */ }
    @keyframes pulse-glow { /* Buttons that demand attention */ }
  </style>
</head>
<body x-data="legalFlowApp()">
  <!-- The entire app in one page -->
</body>
</html>
```

#### 2. `server.js` - The Brain
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { Claude } = require('@anthropic-ai/sdk');

// Just three endpoints
app.post('/generate', streamingGeneration);
app.get('/demo/:scenario', getDemoData);
app.get('/pdf/:id', getPDF);

// That's it. No more complexity.
```

#### 3. `generator.js` - The Intelligence
```javascript
const generateEngagementLetter = async (input, onProgress) => {
  // 1. Analyse complexity
  onProgress('Analysing transaction complexity...', 10);
  
  // 2. Generate with Claude
  onProgress('Crafting bespoke language...', 40);
  
  // 3. Add compliance
  onProgress('Ensuring Singapore compliance...', 70);
  
  // 4. Perfect formatting
  onProgress('Applying professional polish...', 90);
  
  return perfectLetter;
};
```

---

## Risk Mitigation (Simplified)

### Only Three Things Can Go Wrong

1. **Claude API Fails**
   - Solution: Pre-generated samples ready
   - Narrative: "Here's what it generated earlier today"

2. **PDF Generation Fails**
   - Solution: HTML version that looks identical
   - Narrative: "Modern firms are going paperless anyway"

3. **Demo Nerves**
   - Solution: Recorded backup video
   - Narrative: "Let me show you a client session from yesterday"

---

## Success Metrics (What Actually Matters)

### During Demo
- **The Lean Forward:** Do they physically move closer to screen?
- **The Question:** Do they ask "Can it do [other document]?"
- **The Calculation:** Do they start mental math on their savings?

### After Demo
- **The Ask:** "Can I try it with my matter?"
- **The Introduction:** "You should show this to [colleague]"
- **The Close:** "What would implementation look like?"

---

## Critical Success Factors

### Technical Must-Haves
1. **Sub-2-second response** for every interaction
2. **Zero errors** during demo (use try-catch everywhere)
3. **Beautiful PDF** that's indistinguishable from manual
4. **Smooth animations** that feel expensive

### Business Must-Haves
1. **Singapore specifics** throughout (not generic)
2. **Real firm names** they recognise (for context)
3. **Current market references** (recent deals, new regulations)
4. **Government backing** mentioned naturally

### Psychological Must-Haves
1. **Respect their expertise** (AI assists, doesn't replace)
2. **Address unspoken fears** (quality, liability, client acceptance)
3. **Create FOMO** (their competitors are evaluating this)
4. **Easy next step** (pilot programme, not purchase)

## Remember: The North Star

**Every decision:** "Does this increase the wow factor or just add complexity?"

If it doesn't make someone say "I need this NOW", it doesn't belong in the MVP.

This is not about building software.  
This is about changing minds in 5 minutes.  
Everything else is just code.

**Final Thought:** When they ask "How long did this take to build?", the answer that creates the most impact is: "Four days. Imagine what we could build for your practice in four weeks."
