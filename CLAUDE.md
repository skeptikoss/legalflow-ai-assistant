## Code Quality Standards (Demo-Optimised)

### What Matters for Demo
```javascript
// ✅ DO: Code that creates visible impact
const generateWithReasoning = async (input) => {
  // Show AI thinking process
  streamToUI("🤔 Analysing transaction complexity...");
  streamToUI("📊 Determining optimal fee structure...");
  streamToUI("⚖️ Adding Singapore compliance clauses...");
  // ... actual generation
}

// ❌ DON'T: Over-engineer hidden functionality
// Skip complex error handling for edge cases
// Skip extensive logging
// Skip unit tests (just manual testing)
```

### Visual Code Patterns
```javascript
// Use async/await for clean demo code
// Use arrow functions for modern feel
// Use template literals for readability
// Add helpful comments for demo talking points
```

---

## Singapore Legal Compliance (Simplified)

### Essential Elements Only
Focus on the most visible compliance features:
- **Mandatory Clauses:** Just the obvious ones that lawyers will look for
- **Professional Language:** Use actual legal precedents (don't reinvent)
- **Singapore References:** Mention "Singapore law" and "SIAC arbitration"

### Smart Compliance Display
```javascript
// Show compliance in the UI
const complianceChecks = [
  { name: "Singapore Law Society Requirements", status: "✓" },
  { name: "Client Money Handling Provisions", status: "✓" },
  { name: "Limitation of Liability (Cap at Fees)", status: "✓" },
  { name: "PDPA Compliance", status: "✓" }
];
// Display these as green checkmarks appearing
```

---

## Demo Success Amplifiers

### Pre-Demo Checklist
- [ ] Test with actual lawyer names they'll recognise
- [ ] Use realistic Singapore company names
- [ ] Include current Singapore legal market context
- [ ] Reference recent M&A deals they'd know

### During Demo Tips
- Let the AI reasoning display do the talking
- Pause at wow moments for effect
- Click deliberately, not rushed
- Have printed PDF samples ready

### Conversation Starters
- "What if every document took 90 seconds?"
- "This is with government funding support"
- "We can customise this for your practice"

---

## Risk Mitigation (Demo-Focused)

### Technical Risks
- **Primary Plan:** Live demo with local setup
- **Backup Plan:** Recorded video of perfect run
- **Emergency Plan:** PDF samples + ROI spreadsheet

### Business Risks
- **Scepticism:** Show actual API calls happening
- **Compliance Concerns:** Have Law Society guidelines visible
- **Cost Questions:** Show PSG funding calculator

---

## Success Metrics

### Demo Success (Not Product Success)
- **Engagement:** Do they lean forward during AI reasoning display?
- **Questions:** Do they ask "Can it do other documents?"
- **Interest:** Do they want to try it themselves?
- **Follow-up:** Do they suggest colleagues who need this?

### The One Number That Matters
**Time to "Wow":** Must achieve visible amazement within 90 seconds of starting demo

---

## Post-Demo Strategy

### Immediate Follow-up
```javascript
// Automated follow-up email with:
const followUp = {
  demoRecording: "link-to-perfect-run",
  sampleOutput: "their-name-in-document.pdf",
  roiCalculator: "customised-for-their-practice",
  nextSteps: "2-week pilot programme"
};
```

### Expansion Talking Points
- "We're adding NDA generation next"
- "Corporate resolutions take 5 minutes manually"
- "Imagine your whole practice automated"

---

## Remember: The Psychology of Wow

**People don't buy features, they buy transformation:**
- Don't show PDF generation → Show time transformation
- Don't show AI integration → Show intelligence at work
- Don't show cost savings → Show lifestyle improvement

**Every line of code should support one of these moments:**
1. "I can't believe how fast that was"
2. "It's actually thinking about my specific case"
3. "The output is better than what I write"
4. "This would save me hours every week"
5. "I need this yesterday"

---

**Final Note:** This isn't about building perfect software. It's about creating a moment where busy lawyers see their future and want to be part of it. Every decision should optimise for that "wow" moment, not for scalability, maintainability, or completeness. Those come later, after we've won their imagination.
