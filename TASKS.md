## 🎯 Daily Standup Questions

## 💡 Remember: The Demo Mindset

**You're not building software. You're creating a moment.**

The moment when a tired lawyer realises they could leave the office at 6pm instead of 9pm.

Every task, every line of code, every pixel should serve that moment.

If it doesn't contribute to the "wow", delete it.
